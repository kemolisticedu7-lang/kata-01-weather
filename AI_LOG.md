# AI Collaboration Log – Foundation 1
## What I Asked
- Asked for guidance on structuring a dataset discovery and architecture exploration deliverable
- Asked for help identifying architectural characteristics relevant to large, relational government datasets
- Asked for clarification on how instructors evaluate “problem space” versus “problem definition”
## What I Got
- Suggested dataset analysis structure
- Examples of candidate architecture characteristics and trade-offs
- Guidance on framing exploratory observations without committing to a final solution
## What I Used, Modified, or Rejected
- Used the architectural characteristic categories but customized explanations to the aviation domain
- Modified candidate problem statements to ensure they were concrete and business-focused
- Rejected suggestions that assumed real-time system requirements, as those are not yet established
## Judgment Calls
I prioritized scalability, data consistency, and evolvability because of the dataset’s size and historical depth. I intentionally avoided committing to availability or low-latency guarantees since the problem definition has not yet been finalized.
